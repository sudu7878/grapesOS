# grapesOS
grapesOS is a CLI operating system, designed to run on Raspberry Pi in ARM assembly mode.

Here are a few things about this OS:
=1= This OS will support CLI, and I'll be trying GUI later.
=2= This OS will have a modular based system that runs CLI commands under the GUI.
=3= Multimedia and other things would not be supported for the time being, because they are difficult to implement (yeah sorry).
=4= This OS is specifically designed to run on Raspberry Pi infrastructure, where the system boots up by reffering to GPU.
=5= Note that im still trying with different CPU scheduling algos and might end up using all/one of them, and system may be unresponsive.
=6= I'll be trying to implement formatting options for FAT32, and read/write/delete files from the supported disk interface.
=7= Once the OS is stable in its raw form, I would then try to build different functional modules like an API that may be used by other applications running on this system (even though none of them are present rn).


That's all for what i have in my mind about this OS for now. I'll add more as I continue to work on this project, this is just a hobby prpject to explore how the computers actually work under the hood. It's a gread opportunity! If you would like to help me develop, or have some recommendatiosn, please feel free to contact me and help me do it! My discord ID is: sudu_493412. Thank you! Cheers.
